     </div>
     <h2><p>With an understanding of differential equations and their usefulness in solving physical problems, it is customary to study 
     systems of equations to be solved simultaneously (linear algebra) and the usefulness of matrices in simplifying such systems.  The 
     usefulness of matrix methods soon becomes apparent when decompositions are realized, and the all important concepts of eigenvalues 
     and eigenvectors are introduced and begin to become understood by the student.  </p></h2>
