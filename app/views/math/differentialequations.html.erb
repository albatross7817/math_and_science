     <h2><p>Having a solid understanding of calculus and the physical meaning of differential quantities, the student is now prepared 
     to study purely dynamical systems, namely in the form of differential equations.  Most students who have completed a calculus 
     cirriculum will have glazed over the simplest form of a differential equation, namely the exponential decay formula; but the study 
     of differential equations takes on an incredibly rich formulaiton that describes physical systems purely in terms of quantities that 
     change with time and space and depend on where and when the system under consideration is taking place.  The ideas of initial and 
     boundary conditions are essential to the study of differential equations if a solution is hoped to be found; and more often than not
     closed-form analytical solutions do not exist.  One must resort to numerical techniques (numerical analysis) to approximate solutions
     to many differential equations, particularly partial differential equations.  </p></h2>
