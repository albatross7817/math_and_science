Initially geometry is often taught using postulates as outlined by\n     Euclid and the construction of the logical proof process is emphasized.  Many students find this approach tedious and\n     abstract; which, frankly, it is.  The main point to be learned from this introductory material is the logical approach\n     taken to deduce conclusions from a given set of postulates.<br><br>Geometry consists of much more than just the ideas outlined \n     in Euclid's <em>Elements</em>.  Geometry is used to derive simple formulas for areas and volumes of symmetrical objects,\n     but the general case is reserved for the powerful techniques introduced in calculus.  There also exists a separate field \n     of geometry known as analytical geometry which is indespensiable in the study of astrodynamics.  Finally, when calculus\n     is merged with geometry the topic of differential geometry can be introduced, upon which (Einstein's) general theory of \n     relativity is constructed.</p></h2>\n  </body>    \n</html>","undoManager":{"mark":-1,"position":3,"stack":[[{"group":"doc","deltas":[{"start":{"row":9,"column":68},"end":{"row":9,"column":69},"action":"insert","lines":["<"]}]}],[{"group":"doc","deltas":[{"start":{"row":9,"column":69},"end":{"row":9,"column":70},"action":"insert","lines":["b"]}]}],[{"group":"doc","deltas":[{"start":{"row":9,"column":70},"end":{"row":9,"column":71},"action":"insert","lines":["r"]}]}],[{"group":"doc","deltas":[{"start":{"row":9,"column":71},"end":{"row":9,"column":72},"action":"insert","lines":[">"]}]}]]},"ace":{"folds":[],"scrolltop":0,"scrollleft":0,"selection":{"start":{"row":9,"column":72},"end":{"row":9,"column":72},"isBackwards":false},"options":{"guessTabSize":true,"useWrapMode":false,"wrapToView":true},"firstLineState":0},"timestamp":1429769200005}
