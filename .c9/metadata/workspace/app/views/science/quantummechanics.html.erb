One of the basic tenets of quantum mechanics \n     is that the deterministic nature we had grown accustomed to is lost; everything at the quantum level is \n     inherently probabilistic.  Nothing can be determined with absolute certainty, only to within limits given \n     by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  This represents a radical departure from what has been heretofore \n     learned, and arguably much of the difficulty of learning quantum mechanics is realizing and accepting this \n     adjustment.  But the theoretical consistency of quantum mechanics with experimental results are undeniable.  \n     Though seemingly bizarre and awkward, quantum mechanics simply works.  \n     </q></p></h2>\n  </body>    \n</html>","undoManager":{"mark":8,"position":8,"stack":[[{"group":"doc","deltas":[{"start":{"row":13,"column":25},"end":{"row":13,"column":26},"action":"remove","lines":["z"]}]}],[{"group":"doc","deltas":[{"start":{"row":13,"column":26},"end":{"row":13,"column":27},"action":"insert","lines":["r"]}]}],[{"group":"doc","deltas":[{"start":{"row":13,"column":61},"end":{"row":13,"column":62},"action":"insert","lines":["s"]}]}],[{"group":"doc","deltas":[{"start":{"row":13,"column":62},"end":{"row":13,"column":63},"action":"insert","lines":["i"]}]}],[{"group":"doc","deltas":[{"start":{"row":13,"column":63},"end":{"row":13,"column":64},"action":"insert","lines":["m"]}]}],[{"group":"doc","deltas":[{"start":{"row":13,"column":64},"end":{"row":13,"column":65},"action":"insert","lines":["p"]}]}],[{"group":"doc","deltas":[{"start":{"row":13,"column":65},"end":{"row":13,"column":66},"action":"insert","lines":["l"]}]}],[{"group":"doc","deltas":[{"start":{"row":13,"column":66},"end":{"row":13,"column":67},"action":"insert","lines":["y"]}]}],[{"group":"doc","deltas":[{"start":{"row":13,"column":67},"end":{"row":13,"column":68},"action":"insert","lines":[" "]}]}]]},"ace":{"folds":[],"scrolltop":0,"scrollleft":0,"selection":{"start":{"row":0,"column":0},"end":{"row":16,"column":7},"isBackwards":true},"options":{"guessTabSize":true,"useWrapMode":false,"wrapToView":true},"firstLineState":0},"timestamp":1429813597000}
